Here is a **clean, simple, memory-friendly workflow** of the entire **Data Publishing Framework + Databricks Job + External Trigger** process — written as short steps, no code, just pure text.

Use this as your final reference.

# ✅ **Data Publishing Workflow — Easy-to-Remember Steps**

### **1. ETL produces the curated Delta table**

* ETL writes final data to **base path** (e.g., `/mnt/smkt/pfs_ild`).

---

### **2. Databricks job is created**

* Job runs the publishing Python wrapper.
* Job accepts parameters (dataset names, paths, tenants).
* Job is attached to a cluster.

---

### **3. External systems trigger the Databricks job**

* R, AML, Python, Airflow, Azure Function, or DevOps.
* All call **Databricks Jobs API (run-now)**.
* They send the job ID + parameters.

---

### **4. Job starts and reads parameters**

* Gets dataset list.
* Gets base path and publish path.
* Gets tenant list.

---

### **5. For each dataset**

#### 5.1 Validate dataset exists under base path

#### 5.2 Create new version folder

* Timestamp-based directory under publish path.

#### 5.3 Copy curated Delta table to version folder

* Version becomes immutable.

#### 5.4 Create data channel (if not already created)

* First publish only.

#### 5.5 Update pointer

* Pointer now points to the new version folder.
* Old versions remain for rollback.

#### 5.6 Authorize tenants

* Give access to consumer workspaces or groups.

---

### **6. Log publish details**

* Dataset name
* Version created
* Publish path
* Pointer updated
* Tenants authorized

---

### **7. Job returns success response**

* Returned to R / AML / caller system.

---

### **8. Consumers read only via pointer**

* Always access the stable URL.
* No mounts required.
* No impact when new versions are published.

---

# 🎯 **Super-short mnemonic version**

**“ETL → Job → Trigger → Version → Copy → Channel → Pointer → Access → Done.”**

Or even shorter:

**“Produce → Publish → Point → Provide.”**
