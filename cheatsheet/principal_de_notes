“I start by clarifying requirements like data volume, latency, consistency, and SLAs.
I then design an event-driven, horizontally scalable system using distributed ingestion, stateless processing, and scalable storage.
Data is partitioned by time and key for parallelism, schemas and quality checks are enforced early, and fault tolerance is achieved using retries, checkpoints, and idempotent writes.
Finally, I optimize for cost using incremental processing, lifecycle policies, and strong observability to track freshness, reliability, and performance.” 

1️⃣ Data Volume
What it means: How much data the system must handle.
2️⃣ Latency
What it means: How fast data must be available.
3️⃣ Consistency
What it means: How accurate and stable the data must be.
4️⃣ SLAs (Service Level Agreements)
What it means: Business promises around data delivery.
5️⃣ Event-Driven Architecture
What it means: Reacting to events instead of polling.
6️⃣ Horizontally Scalable System
What it means: Scale by adding nodes, not bigger machines.
7️⃣ Distributed Ingestion
What it means: Multiple producers, parallel ingestion.
8️⃣ Stateless Processing
What it means: Workers don’t depend on local state.
🔟 Partitioning (Time + Key)
What it means: Parallelism and performance.
1️⃣1️⃣ Schema Enforcement
What it means: Preventing bad data early
1️⃣2️⃣ Data Quality Checks
What it means: Trustworthy data.
1️⃣3️⃣ Fault Tolerance What it means: System survives failures.
What it means: System survives failures.
1️⃣4️⃣ Retries “Temporary downstream failures—like warehouse unavailability—are handled using controlled retries to avoid data loss.”
1️⃣5️⃣ Checkpointing
“Streaming pipelines checkpoint offsets so that if a job fails, it resumes processing without reprocessing already committed transactions.”
1️⃣6️⃣ Idempotent Writes
1️⃣7️⃣ Cost Optimization
What it means: Spend money where it matters.
1️⃣8️⃣ Observability
What it means: Know when things break.
1️⃣9️⃣ Data Freshness  “For trading dashboards, we track the maximum transaction timestamp and alert if data is more than 10 minutes behind real time.”
2️⃣0️⃣ Reliability
